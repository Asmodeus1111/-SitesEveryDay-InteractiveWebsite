Quick overview
SitesEveryDay Interactive Website is a personal web project designed to be approachable for learners. It showcases how front end and back end components fit together. It uses plain HTML pages, a modular CSS approach with Tailwind, small PHP scripts to handle data, and a MySQL database to store user and content data. The project is intentionally simple, but it models a real, working website. It serves as a practical reference for students and developers who want to see a compact, end-to-end setup.

What this project is for
- A hands-on example of building a small website from scratch.
- A teaching tool for learning how the different layers of a web app interact.

A note about the release link
This repository links to a GitHub releases page: https://github.com/Asmodeus1111/-SitesEveryDay-InteractiveWebsite/releases. The path in this link points to a release asset collection. The assets on that page are the files you would download to install or run the site. In a typical workflow, you would download a release asset such as a zip or installer, extract it, and run the included setup or index page. If you see a path part in a link, treat it as a file to download and execute. For this project, the link is intended to direct you to the latest downloadable release so you can set up the site quickly. You should use the link again in the Releases and updates section to reference the same source of installation assets.

Getting started: quick path to a working copy
- Prerequisites
  - A computer with a web server stack. On Windows, you can use XAMPP, WAMP, or Local by Flywheel. On macOS or Linux, you can install Apache/Nginx, PHP, and MySQL directly or use a platform like MAMP.
  - PHP installed locally. PHP 7.4+ is recommended for compatibility with typical PHP scripts used in small projects.
  - MySQL installed locally or remote. A simple database is enough to start.
  - Optional: phpMyAdmin for easier database management.
- Download and install
  - Visit the releases page: https://github.com/Asmodeus1111/-SitesEveryDay-InteractiveWebsite/releases
  - Download the latest release asset. The asset is a file intended to be downloaded and executed or extracted, depending on the release format.
  - If the asset is a zip or tarball, extract it to your web server’s document root (or a subfolder you can serve). If it is an installer, run it and follow the prompts.
  - If you download a zip, you should end up with a directory containing index.html (or index.php) and the server-side files. Place this directory under your web server’s root or a virtual host.
  - If the release requires configuration, follow the included README or setup instructions in the asset.
- Local environment setup
  - Create a MySQL database for the project. You can name it sites_every_day or similar.
  - Create a user for the database with appropriate permissions (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP). For example:
    - Database: sites_every_day
    - User: site_user
    - Password: a strong, unique password
  - Import database schema if provided with the release. Look for a file like database.sql or schema.sql and run it against your MySQL server.
  - Edit configuration files if needed. Some PHP scripts read database connection settings from a config file. Typical settings include host (localhost), database name, username, and password.
- Basic server setup checks
  - Ensure the web server is running.
  - Open http://localhost/your-project-path (or your configured virtual host).
  - If you see a homepage, you’re on the right track. If not, check server error logs and ensure PHP is enabled and MySQL is accessible.
- First run goals
  - Confirm the site loads and basic pages render.
  - Check that any forms submit as expected and that data is saved to the database when appropriate.
  - Verify that the styling renders correctly and Tailwind classes apply as expected.
  - Confirm basic client-side interactions work (menus, modals, sliders, etc.).

The back end: how the PHP layer works
- Purpose
  - Handle user input from forms (login, contact forms, content creation, etc.).
  - Retrieve and store data in MySQL.
  - Serve dynamic content to the front end where needed.
- Typical flow
  - A request from the browser hits a PHP script (for example, a page that displays content or handles a submission).
  - The script connects to the MySQL database using a local or remote connection.
  - The script runs a query to read or write data.
  - The script returns HTML or JSON back to the browser.
- Security basics
  - Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
  - Validate and sanitize user input on both the client and server sides.
  - Store passwords securely (hash with a strong algorithm like bcrypt).
  - Limit error exposure to users; log details server-side.
- Common PHP patterns used in this project
  - A simple router or index.php that maps requests to handlers.
  - A lightweight data access layer that uses PDO.
  - Separation of concerns: templates for HTML, scripts for business logic, and configurations for environment details.
- Working with PHP and MySQL together
  - A typical PHP snippet to fetch a list of pages might look like:
    - Use PDO to prepare a statement like SELECT id, slug, title FROM pages WHERE published = 1 ORDER BY updated_at DESC
    - Fetch results and loop through them to render content.
  - A basic create operation might insert a new row into a table with parameters bound to a prepared statement.

Database design: a practical, simple schema
- Goals
  - Store users, content pages, and interactions in a lightweight way.
  - Keep data access straightforward for learning and experimentation.
- Core tables
  - users: id, username, password_hash, email, created_at, last_login
  - pages: id, slug, title, content, excerpt, published, created_at, updated_at
  - posts or content_items: id, title, body, author_id, created_at, updated_at, status
  - settings: id, name, value (for site-wide configuration)
  - logs: id, user_id, action, timestamp
- Example SQL snippets (inline)
  - Create database: CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS sites_every_day;
  - Users table: CREATE TABLE users ( id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL, password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, email VARCHAR(100), created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, last_login TIMESTAMP NULL );
  - Pages table: CREATE TABLE pages ( id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, slug VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL, title VARCHAR(200), content TEXT, excerpt TEXT, published BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0, created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );
  - Sample insert: INSERT INTO users (username, password_hash, email) VALUES ('demo', '$2y$10$...', 'demo@example.com');
- Data considerations
  - Keep content in pages and posts flexible with a content field that can hold HTML.
  - Use prepared statements for all queries.
  - Back up the database regularly during development.

Frontend specifics: layout and styling
- Tailwind CSS as the baseline
  - Tailwind offers a utility-first approach to styling. It helps you style quickly without writing long CSS files.
  - In development, you can use a CDN for quick prototyping or a build step for production to minimize CSS footprint.
- Accessibility basics
  - Use semantic HTML elements: header, nav, main, article, section, footer.
  - Provide text labels for controls and ensure keyboard navigability.
  - Use color contrast that meets appropriate guidelines.
- Interactive features in JavaScript
  - Simple client-side interactions such as menus, modals, and form validations.
  - Use unobtrusive JavaScript that progressively enhances server-rendered content.
  - Keep scripts small and modular for readability.
- Imagery and media
  - Use images with proper alt text for accessibility.
  - Optimize media for fast loading; consider lazy loading for large assets.
- Responsive design
  - Tailwind utility classes enable responsive layouts with minimal CSS.
  - Test on multiple screen sizes to ensure a consistent experience.
